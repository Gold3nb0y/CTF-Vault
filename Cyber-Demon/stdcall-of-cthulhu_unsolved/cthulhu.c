 “ They worshipped, so they said, the Great Old Ones
   who lived ages before there were any men, and who
   came to the young world out of the sky. Those Old Ones
   were gone now, inside the earth and under the sea;
   but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams
   to the first men, who formed a cult which had never
   died.

   This was that cult, and the prisoners said it had
   always existed and always would exist, hidden in distant
   wastes and dark places all over the world until the time
   when the great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in
   the mighty city of R’lyeh under the waters, should rise
   and bring the earth again beneath his sway. Some day he
   would call, when the stars were ready, and the secret
   cult would always be waiting to liberate him. “
