# CTF vault

This is a collection of all of the CTF's I have participated in, and also made progress in.
While I have competed in a few more than are in here, I deemed that I did not make significant enough progress on any of them to consider their inclusion.

I have tried my best to classify challenges by appending a status message to the end of the directory names. The names have the following meanings.
- solved   : Solved by me during the competition window
- upsolved : Solved after the competition, usually using other peoples solutions/help from writeups.
- unsolved : Not solved, but attempt was made to solve(usually)
- assisted : Worked as a part of a greater team to solve, solution may not be included in the directory, but my work is

There are some other catagories I included as well, such as work in progress

In addition to what is included in here, I have done many other challenges from sites such as pwnable.kr/pwnable.tw as well as some of the PWN challenges on HTB.
However, as these are still ongoing I Don't want to include them as to not spoil the challenge.

One more thing, A ghidra repository that contained most of the reversing I had done for these challenges was greater than githubs size limit, so I had to remove it. This and a few other files such as kernel images

I hope you enjoy browsing the depths of my grinding
