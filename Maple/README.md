# MapleCTF 2023

I feel like I did a really solid job reversing this challenge. the source code was given about 7 hours before then end during a time that I couldn't compete, which felt a bit bad. I was able to get a leak before the source code was distributed. The thing I am stuck on now is figuring out how to abuse the UAF. I have been working on this for some time now, but am a bit stuck. waiting for the author solve to put me on the right track to finish up
