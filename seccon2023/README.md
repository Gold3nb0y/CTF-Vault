I really enjoyed this ctf, especially the usermode challenge which was interesting in the way that the way the kernel module was structured played a role in how the usermode binary was exploited.

Sadly, I got super sick during the CTF, so I didn't have time to try to kernel portion of the challenge.

I did review it however, and is has to do with how the kernel handles mmap faults.
