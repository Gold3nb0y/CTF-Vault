# swedish memcpy

I didn't solve this challenge or upsolve it, but I remember finding the solution very interesting. the solution revolved around setting the direction flag in assmebly via STD. with the direction flag set, you can read backwards into the flag and cause it to print

This was super interesting to me, and helped me learn a lot about how flags work in assembly programs
