This challenge has been really fun for me as there are tons of different ways to go about it. I started out by learning how to do it with dirty pipe, and have recently been trying to complete it with cross cache!

# Chovid99

Update October 19th:
- I have not been able to complete the cross-cache section.
- While I am now familiar with the technique, for some reason I am no longer able to trigger the page free from the per cpu cache to the buddy allocator.
- The weird thing is that I was using another players exploit to help me, chovid99, but their exploit no longer works when running on my machine as well
- I am unsure why thing is the case, but I will keep looking into it.
