# Balsn 2023

I competed in this CTF with the merger that ultimately won! While I didn't help out too much, it was still a  fun experience collarborating with new CTF players. I was able to help a bit with the baby_rop challenge, but ultimately someone else solved it. I spent most of my time working on the kernel level section of the fullchain challenge ASTRAL, but got stuck. I spent wayyyy to much time tunneling on how to do a user signature so I could use the deregister applet systemcall. 

For the future, I will spend some time working with, the crypto library in C so I have a better shot at solving a challenge like this.

And, for what it is worth, the deregister syscall was necessary for the solution.
